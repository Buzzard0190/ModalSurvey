## Notes

   * Graph does not have function for piece title and subtitle
   
   * Radio buttons stay on previous choice for easy and quick debugging
   
   * AssesmentSurveyApp.js holds the functions that control the html communication
   
   * SurveyAnswerController.js holds the survey answer objects and prototype functions for objects
   
   * surveyQuestionData.json holds all the questions and the expected answer styles
   
   
## Future Improvements and Bug Fixes

   * Not user friendly, fix this! How can a user break this app?
     
   * Back button needs implemented 
   
   * If user choice already exists on previously loaded answer, reload
   
   * Make code read from any quantity of questions
   
   * Color code sections of graph
   
   * Need to change radio buttons for boolean style input when needed
   
   * Clear input from previous question, this is a purposeful bug right now
   * surveyQuestionData.json needs updated to hold the section titles
